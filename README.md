This study is based on the following article:

"Exploring the Relation between Technical Debt and Software Trustworthiness"

We selected 106 different Android projects for this research. 16 different metrics of the projects were calculated as stated in the article.

External metrics were measured with Sonar, while internal Quality metrics were analyzed with the Understand tool. 33 of the 106 projects were taken from the article, 73 of them were added later to expand the research.

During the work with the Understand tool, the Java source codes of all projects were analyzed and their internal metrics were measured one by one. The average values of the metrics were taken and added to the dataset.
